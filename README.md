# Anime Image Upscaling with Fine-Tuned Real-ESRGAN

## Project Description

### Background  
In this project, we explored a variety of Deep Learning models to upscale anime images.  
After thorough testing and comparison, the R-ESRGAN 4x model demonstrated the best results.  
Our goal is to fine-tune the R-ESRGAN model specifically for anime and anime upscaling tasks.

## Methodology/Proposed Approach

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - We sourced our image dataset from existing anime content.  
   - The size of the dataset is subject to change over the duration of the project.  

2. **Data Annotation and Preprocessing**  
   - Annotate the dataset for relevant features.  
   - Generate low-resolution image variants to simulate input for the model.

## Results: Image Comparison

Below is a comparison between a low-quality anime image and its upscaled version using our fine-tuned model:

| Low-Quality Image | Upscaled Image |
|--------------------|----------------|
| ![Low Quality](insert_low_quality_image_path_here) | ![Upscaled](insert_upscaled_image_path_here) |
